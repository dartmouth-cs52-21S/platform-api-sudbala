# Platform API 
*Here I have created a platform API for my horror post website, NoSleep. This is essentially the backend to that platform client. Requests filed from that client all get passed to this api, which, by using express js, parses the request, performs the correct functions, and then sends back a response to the platform client. The API communicates between our client (lab4) and a Mongo Cloud Atlas DB.*

## What Worked Well
Everything worked well! Once I understood things, everything sailed quite smoothly. The example with createPost on the post_controller really helped move the other functions along.

## What Didn't
There was a lot of provided code this lab, it took a while to parse through what all of it mean,t but this isn't necessarily something that didn't work well lol. It's just I had to learn about the different pieces of express and routing. But it all worked out, putting pieces together from class and the lab.

## Extra Credit
* Soon to come!
